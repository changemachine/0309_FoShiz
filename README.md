# Fo Shizzle Generator for Epicodus
## by Daniel Toader and James Nielson
### Date: March 09, 2015
#### Description
The Fo Shizzle Generator will turn a given phrase into Snoop-speak.  In general, an s in a word will be replaced with a 'z'.  An s at the beginning of a word will not be changed, nor will an capitalized S.  Not sure what that second exclusion would look like, but an example of the first would be a translation from "Susan's got mad skills" to "Susan'z got mad skillz."

#### Setup instructions
1. Clone this git repository
2. Set your localhost root folder to ~/FoShizzle/web/
3. Ensure PHP server is running.
4. Start the web app by pointing your browser to the root (http://localhost:8000/)
